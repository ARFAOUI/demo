# Dispaying a tableview of bus stations with Google Maps Location Images and live updating for arrival time Using NSURLSessionTask (UnitTest included)


possible improvements:
storing the estimates in a proper object instead of displaying directly the data
reading more then one bus arrival time in the same station (currently we are reading only the next one)
